# maniFEM
This directory contains several examples of use of the
[maniFEM](https://github.com/cristian-barbarosie/manifem) library.

Each file corresponds to a paragraph in the
[manual](http://manifem.rd.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/manual-manifem.pdf).
An exception is `parag-12.10.cpp` which is left in the root directory (parent of this one)
because we want it to work as a stand-alone example for
[MetricTree](https://github.com/cristian-barbarosie/MetricTree).
Also, files named `parag-test-*` are an exception (they do not correspond to paragraphs in the manual).

To run these examples, you should be in the parent directory.
Just `make run-1.1` for the example in paragraph 1.1, 
`make run-2.6` for the example in paragraph 2.6, and so on.
More details [here](https://github.com/cristian-barbarosie/manifem/blob/main/README.md) or
in paragraph 11.16 of the [manual](http://manifem.rd.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/manual-manifem.pdf).
