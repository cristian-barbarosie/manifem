# maniFEM
This directory contains several examples of use of the [maniFEM](https://github.com/cristian-barbarosie/manifem) library.

Each file corresponds to a paragraph in the [manual](http://manifem.rd.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/manual-manifem.pdf), with the exception of files named `parag-test-*`.

To run these examples, you should be in the parent directory.
Just `make run-1.1` for the example in paragraph 1.1, 
`make run-2.6` for the example in paragraph 2.6, and so on.
More details [here](https://github.com/cristian-barbarosie/manifem/blob/main/README.md)
or in the introduction of the [manual](http://manifem.rd.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/manual-manifem.pdf).
